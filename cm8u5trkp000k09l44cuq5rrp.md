[Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/) is a JavaScript data grid library for web applications, developed by [Handsoncode](https://handsoncode.net/about-us). It is an alternative to other data grid libraries such as [Tanstack table](https://tanstack.com/table/) and [react-data-grid](https://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid/#/CommonFeatures).

In the [latest release of Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/blog/handsontable-15.2.0-stability-improvements), [Persian translation](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/11388), contributed by me, was included and Iâ€™m proud to be a part of Handsontable community and web open-source community.

I hope I could be a more useful member of this community and also, Persian-speaking community.

In hope of a free Iran.
